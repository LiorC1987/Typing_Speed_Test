    "You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing.",

    "In her heart she is a mourner for those who have not survived. In her soul she is a warrior for those who are now as she was then. In her life she is both celebrant and proof of women's capacity and will to survive, to become, to act, to change self and society. And each year she is stronger and there are more of her.",
    "And this shall be a great oath before you: some day longing for Achilleus will come to the sons of the Achaians, all of them. Then stricken at heart though you be, you will be able to do nothing, when in their numbers before man-slaughtering Hecktor they drop and die. And then you will eat out your heart within you in sorrow, that you did no honor to the best of the Achaians.",
    "People - we're fond of our habits, and we are what we do repeatedly. If we could hold our lives without ourselves in them, we would see the bigger impact our smallest actions created.

    "If your ambition is to maximize short-term gain without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing the cost. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it's better never to really understand those problems. There is an upside to ignorance, and a downside to knowledge. Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview.",

    "Every time it seems like the evening just turns into another dawn and dawn into the noon and so on and so forth, try to stay positive and think about all the things you would not do once outside. Like wearing your best pajamas all day long, picking your nose or just letting the wind go whenever you want it. Face it - there are also good sides to being in quarantine, and until the electricity still runs strong let us enjoy downloading the entirety of the Internet to save for future generations.",
    "I don't have any problem understanding why people flunk out of college or quit their jobs or cheat on each other or break the law or spray-paint walls.

I sell pills to help people find themselves and pills to help them lose themselves when they require escape from the pressures and anxieties of life in a complex society.",
    "We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you. We are very very happy for your success.

    "Well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, debutante. You want to start a street fight with me? Bring it on. But you're going to be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the lizard king!",
    "For me, comedy starts as a spew, a kind of explosion, and then you sculpt it from there, if at all. It comes out of a deeper, darker side.

    "Go ahead and quit, if you can't see it through. But don't come crying to me, when quitting is all you do. Those who start to quit, when things start getting tough, start to see quitting, as a way to get out of stuff. They never stick things through, and can't complete a thing. Is this the type of person you see yourself being? Quitters never win, no matter what you've heard. Have you ever heard a quitter, that is picked to be referred? Of course that would be silly, why would someone refer?",
    "Thus there are always plenty of people who profit by State swindling. They egg governments on to inflate, and oppose all attempts to deflate. For them a year of inflation is a year of prosperity. A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.",
    "Our code is different from the warrior code. It reaches across boundaries. To us, every cat is simply that - a cat, with the same right to life as any other. We made a promise to heal and protect, remember?",
